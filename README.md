# NodeJS template

A basic Node.js app using Express and ejs templates.

## How to use

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

This boilerplate comes as two options, "basic" or "advanced". 

The basic version has everything you need to start coding a simple website.
The advanced version contains some security functionality using sessions, csrf tokens, rate limiting and so on, as well as server logging using Winston.

cd into "basic" or "advanced" and use:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

By default your app will run on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).
